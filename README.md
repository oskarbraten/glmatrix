# glmatrix

A linear algebra library for computer graphics written in Rust.

## Goal
This library aims to be easy to use, lightweight, efficient at run-time and with fast compilation times. Additionally it aims to provide an API that is familiar for those that are used to the Javascript library known as [glMatrix](https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix).

## Features
 - Generic types via the Float-trait in num (without becoming unreadable)
 - Operator overloading where it makes sense
 - Data is stored in arrays making it easy to transfer to the GPU

## Todo
- [ ] mat2
- [ ] mat2d
- [ ] mat3
- [x] mat4
- [x] quat
- [ ] quat2
- [ ] vec2
